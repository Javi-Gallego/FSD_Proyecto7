This is the seventh project in the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp at GeeksHubs. In these two weeks I've tried to make my own version of a social network. I hope you like it.

## About the project

Create a social network that allows users to post messages.

To do that you must register and login.

Along the text of maximum 150 characters you can send an image and write keywords. These key words are used to make statistics of what people is talking about and to search posts throught words (not implemented actually).

You can change your photo profile, your password or add your name and lastname to your profile info. You can also make your profile public or private if you don't want to be seen by anyone and for that, one of the main features is that you can follow users and they can follow you. Anyone in your following list can see your post even if your account is set to private.

As superadmin you can see and delete any user and use filters the search.

## Local installation

1. Clone the repository
` $ git clone https://github.com/Javi-Gallego/FSD_Proyecto7.git `
2. Install dependencies
` $ npm install `
3. Run React project
` $ npm run dev `

Unfortunately, the server is hosted on a free site and it is very likely that is not online the moment you want to see this project. In this link you have the repository (an Express made server working with a MySQL database) and the instructions to install it locally:
https://github.com/Javi-Gallego/FSD_Proyecto5.git

If you need to run the server locally, you will need to go to /src/services/apiCalls.js and put the right urlRoot.

## Problems solutions
A lot of changes in the API because it was not made with front end point of view. Almost as many commits to fix things in the server as in the front end. It was good to see both points of view for the first time.

## Future features
[ ] Tattoo artists can also make and update appointments on their own.
[ ] Add Tatto artist section with their works and bio.
[ ] CRUD for catalog as super admin
[ ] Maybe, to buy a piercing you do not need to make an appointment, just go to the shop. So you can see the service but cannot make an appointment with that service.
[ ] Add piercings images to the catalog.
[ ] Add role for piercing artists if they are different from the tattoo ones, add another role for the artists than can do both.

## Development:

``` js
 const developer = "Javier Gallego";

 console.log("Desarrollado por: " + developer);
```
